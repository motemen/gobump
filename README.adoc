= gobump

gobump bumps up program version by rewriting `version`-like variable/constant values in the Go source code.

== USAGE

    usage: gobump (-major|-minor|-patch|-set <version>) [-w] [<path>]
      -major=false: bump major version up
      -minor=false: bump minor version up
      -patch=false: bump patch version up
      -set="": set exact version (no bump)
      -w=false: write result to (source) file instead of stdout

== EXAMPLE

Suppose you have a source file:

[source,go]
----
package main

const version = "2.3.4" // Must follow semver spec
----

If you run

    gobump -w -minor

you will get:

----
package main

const version = "2.4.0"
----

Other usages:

    gobump -major # 2.3.4 -> 3.0.0
    gobump -minor # 2.3.4 -> 2.4.0
    gobump -patch # 2.3.4 -> 2.3.5
